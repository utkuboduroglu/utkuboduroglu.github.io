# About me

Hey there! I'm Utku, a Master's student in the [Technical University
of Munich](https://tum.de){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener
noreferrer"}, working on Higher Category Theory.  I'm specifically
interested in the intersection of category theory with programming,
though this is not what my thesis is about.

You can visit my [Git
page](https://git.disroot.org/utkuboduroglu){:target="_blank"
:rel="noopener noreferrer"} (hosted on Github though that is due to
change real soon) here, and you can contact me at  ``` utkubod [at]
protonmail [dot] com ```  or shoot me a message on Mastodon:
[@utku@gladtech.social](https://gladtech.social/@utku){:target="_blank"
:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Any opinions expressed on this site is completely my own unless
specified otherwise.

# About this blog
I've felt the need to make a blog, not just so I could have a place to
put my half-baked ideas, but also to share thoughts about things I do
in my life. You can read more about it here:

## On the use of JavaScript
This page <em>currently contains JavaScript</em> for the purposes of
rendering TikZ diagrams and including KaTeX fonts, though both of
these things are subject to change. In any case, most of the page is
designed to not require JavaScript to view the contents. I do plan on
creating some interactive pages that will have to use JS in the
future, though this isn't case as of yet.

## On AI
Although AI has incredibly domain-specific use cases that I view to be
valid (such as practicing your language skills conversationally[^1]) ,
_I am vehemently opposed to the use of AI as if it's a panacea_, as I
consider it a sorry excuse intellectually, completely vapid and
insulting artistically, and unmistakably poisonous to life given that
the prospect of AI is (as with any technology solely pointed at
reproducing the faculties of human beings) replacing real human beings
for the sake of profit.

It is further an insult to life considering the amount of natural
resources—such as land, fuel and water—that go into running the data
centers responsible for producing the most useless output known to
humankind. I'd rather expend a mountainous amount of effort into
producing something incorrect, unimpressive, tired, contrived, or just
_worthless_ on my own than delegate any part of it to a
probabilistic-inference-spitting machine that will simply produce a
facsimile of thought, labor or emotion.  Speaking of, it's insulting
that we're calling it an artificial _intelligence_, even though we
know for a fact that there is nothing intelligent about it.
