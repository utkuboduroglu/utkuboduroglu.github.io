I love the idea of *webrings*: they essentially organize people who
self-identify under some label, value or interest under a "collective
roof", so to speak.  For example, if you identify with the idea that
[you are opposed to AI](/about), then the ["no ai
webring"](https://baccyflap.com/noai/) is perfect for you! You simply
apply to join the webring, and if you are accepted, you insert some
code in your personal webpage that links you to other people in the
webring in a way that, if you started to repeatedly visit the people
"to your left", you would eventually end up at your own blog; hence a
web<i>ring</i>. There's no need to go out and hope that an algorithm
connects you with other people who share the same interests as you,
and also hope that it doesn't harvest a bunch of behavioral data about
you and sell it to anyone who asks for it in the meantime.

Webrings are a technology from a previous time, but by no means does
this mean that they're obsolete or primitive. As one of my favorite
lines from one of my favorite books goes:

> As if merit was a function of chronology! But it seemed to me that
> the wisdom of the ancients could not have simply vanished.

> Nothing simply vanishes.

I certainly believe that something as simple as the concept of a
webring is more in spirit of the "dream of the internet" as a system
that connects and enables people compared to the contemporary systems
of social media and data harvesting; I would even go so far as to say
that whatever current model of business these companies operate under
are _antithetical to serving people and our desires for a free
internet_. These systems may not have started out as structures
designed to exploit their users, but they certainly have devolved,
through the surrounding logic of surveillance capitalism[^4], into
structures that exploit their users and customers for as much
behavioral data as possible, which acts as fuel for their
"revenue-producing machines".

Such a logic of exploitation and extraction, self-professed by the
"leaders of industry"[^5], cannot possibly serve the people and their
desires and demands for privacy, safety or the well-being of
themselves and their community. You absolutely can meet like-minded
people and form meaningful connections inside these structures, but
only because these connections are observable in a way that produces
revenue for the masters of said structures. You are only allowed to
hold these conversations because _you are given permission to do so_,
something that can be taken from away you at any moment.

[^5]: One does not need to look far to see this. Besides all the
    anecdotal evidence you can come up with, the modern economic
    theories our markets operate under are founded on something called
    _Game Theory_, a mathematical framework that seeks to explain the
    logic of how competing or co-operating parties will be motivated
    to act. The problem here is that in order to be able to model
    these interactions mathematically, people had to _simplify the
    interactions they were observing_, because writing anything down
    in a rigorous way mathematically is a **\*painful
    endeavor\***. One such development is the formulation of actors as
    "rational", a definition that posits that actors behave in such a
    way as to [maximize their self-identified
    utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility#Functions), and
    from such a formulation, they were able to come up with concepts
    such as that of the [Pareto
    optimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) and
    [equilibrium
    point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium), which
    combine to orient game theory around exploring strategies where
    the goal is to "exploit" the other as much as strategically
    possible, with the exact definition of "stragetically possible"
    also an object of interest.  
	Now, this is rarely how things play
    out in real life. As it stands, there is no ill intent on the part
    of the mathematicians who proposed this. However, the fact that a
    mathematical formulation of economics and then policy (which are
    things that very much impact the lives of real people) are based
    on assumptions about people and companies that just aren't true,
    result in our economical frameworks prioritizing the exploitation
    of others because a model that has no bearing on reality says so.

In a social structure where ideas like "exponential growth at all
costs" are central to the conduct of businesses, there is no way these
platforms will offer us a way out of their exploitative practices if
we _just ask nicely_; we need to talk about the conditions we're
subjugated to, and we need to act on our needs and desires. None of
that will be possible by conducting these conversations on the terms
laid out by those who profit from suppressing them, and thus the tools
we need to facilitate such dialogue and action needs to be built
together and without conceding the necessary freedoms to those who
benefit from preventing us those freedoms.

This is why we need to gravitate towards technologies where we're
allowed to form communities and communicate, but are also given the
option to remake the rules of the communities together, and
conveniently migrate to ones that _do let us participate in such a
way_ if the current one is suddenly bought out for 44 billion $ by
some insecure manchild who wants an army of yes men and shills around
him.

And this absolutely is possible! We already have federated
platforms[^1] such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) that rely
on a communication protocol called
[ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) that makes interacting with
others hassle-free. We have ideas from history, such as webrings, that
let you include yourself in communities you identify with, and
simultaneously express yourself without having to sell every single
detail about your digital and physical presence to companies to gain
passage into spaces you call your own, which already should be yours
without others' permission. 

[^1]: Check out more federated platforms, gathered under the name of
    _the fediverse_ [here](https://fediverse.party/)!

I also feel the need to stress a point here. A lot of the discussions
surrounding ideas like webrings or hosting your own personal blog
paints a picture that since these things are from a "yesteryear" of
the internet, they must be primitive or inferior to whatever we have
now. It is true that a personal webpage almost always has less bells
and whistles compared to a service like Instagram, which is the
product of thousands of employees, using their years worth of
expertise in roles that are specialized on doing very specific
things. But this does not mean that it's an archaic form of
interacting with each other. Suggesting that the spaces you carve out
for yourself are inherently less worthy because it looks worse than
something a couple thousand engineers produced with a total of a
hundred years' worth of their labor, is just another way of framing
digital spaces exclusively as commodities, and that the only way you
can keep in touch with your communities or learn things or do business
is by _buying the permission to do so_ from the people in charge,
whether with actual money or by consenting to be exploited and spied
on.

You can refuse this. The praxis that follows the refusal, and the
conversations necessary to carry out that praxis is not written down
in rules anywhere. There is no easy, prescribed way to carry out
change for better conditions for all, but it's possible by trying. So,
in this spirit, I want to use the remainder of this post to highlight
that certain practices, such as the use and development of free and
open source software, as well as investing time in forming communities
that follow different "logics" than that of contemporary platforms is
certainly a step in the right direction. But it is critical for you to
keep in mind that [these are just the tools and not the solution to
the
problem](https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/31/unsatisfying-answers/){:class="fancy-italic"}.

## Why FOSS matters
Let me preface this section by emphasising that although free[^2] and
open-source software _is not sufficient_ for obtaining these spaces
that offer us our freedoms, it certainly is necessary. [The reasons
for this are manifold](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/), however it
boils down to the following: you cannot form spaces that offer you the
freedom to privacy, security and agency _if the tools you use do not
allow you to freely modify or distribute them_. You cannot build a
foundation over systems where someone else can come along and rob you
of the functionality you rely on. This is already how it is; you have
no control over the recommendation algorithms for the apps you use. On
top of this, you cannot just probe into the program and take out all
the parts that do not interest you or harm you. It's precisely because
you are discouraged by [the obfuscation that comes with reading
assembly](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) or
the IP law [that heavily penalizes you if you modify these
programs](https://pluralistic.net/2025/02/22/ink-spattered-pitchforks/),
and such discouragement is intentional on the part of policymakers and
those who make these platforms. As such, it's all the more important
that [the tools we use serve the purpose at
hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does).

[^2]: <i class="fancy-italic">"Free not as in beer, but as in
    freedom"</i> is the commonly repeated phrase; it captures the
    idea that you have certain freedoms that come with software. You
    can read more about exactly what those are in this page detailing
    [What is Free
    Software?](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

What _are_ the tools we can use then? There are a lot of alternatives
for the programs we use every day, from messaging apps like
[Signal](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android),
[Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip),
[Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon),
[Element](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web) and so on to
office productivity programs such as
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/source-code/) and
[Cryptpad](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad), to full-blown
operating systems such as [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) or (if you
can manage to be completely _proprietary-free_) [other distros such as
Trisquel](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html). The Free
Software Foundation is focused more on the actual software and rights
activism that surrounds it, and so they have already made
recommendation guides for [switching to _libre
alternatives_](https://www.fsf.org/givingguide/v16/).

Obviously, a mass exodus on your own is not really possible; you'll be
leaving all your loved ones and other connections behind, and if
you've ever tried to engage in any form of activism, you'll know that
it's _almost impossible to jolt people into action_ in this way. So,
there will be plenty of times where you'll need to make concessions in
the platforms and apps you use in order to keep the dialogue around
the conditions you're in going. But this doesn't mean you should stop
trying. As you become conscious of the conditions you're in as a
collective, it will be the will of said collective to emancipate
themselves from these conditions. _It helps to be knowledgeable of the
potential for action in order to carry it out in the future_.

## Consciousness of communities
Although technology plays a major role in the specific form of
oppression enacted by the companies whose products we're forced[^3] to
use, the issue at hand, when you get down to its core, is not related
to anything fundamentally digital. These systems are byproducts of an
economic model that holds **profit at all costs** as its fundamental
maxim, doing away with any understanding of business or labor as a
means of betterment of society, or the communities that constitute it,
or the people who form these communities. The focus of the business is
only on the _individual_ and not the person, because the individual is
an atomized version of the person it signifies. The individual can be
and will be exploited for the maximum amount of profit one can produce
from it. As a result, it's wishful thinking to hope that these
businesses and the platforms they develop hold our best interests in
mind. Our best interests are distinctly _uneconomic_, and as such will
be optimized out of the equation.

[^3]: I use the word _forced_ here to highlight one thing in
    particular: it is true that no one is forced to use these
    platforms and can use whatever else, or nothing at all, as they
    please. It is also true, however, that if you decide not to use
    these platforms in question, then your options are [severely
    limited](https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/18/market-discipline/)—if
    they exist at all—and are subject to all kinds of factors, such as
    [network
    effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect). For
    example, if you wish to stop using Spotify for streaming your
    music because you're concerned about the fact that one of the
    biggest streaming platforms in the face of the Earth is paying
    [the artists that actually produce the art that you listen to next
    to
    nothing](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/spotify-says-its-payouts-are-getting-better-but-artists-still-disagree/),
    or if you want to cancel your membership because you're concerned
    that all the money you're paying [goes to developing AI strike
    drones](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-07-31/spotifys-ceo-owns-an-ai-weapons-company-some-musicians-say-its-time-to-leave),
    then you'll be somewhat shocked to learn that _there is no
    alternative_ that provides DRM-free music _and_ treats the artists
    and the workers they employ with the dignity they deserve, _and_
    has a catalogue of music in which you're interested in. The
    closest we got is Bandcamp, who has a sound model for paying their
    artists, but they also engage in
    [union-busting](https://www.bandcampunited.org/), so there's that.

Even though the rhetoric surrounding these sorts of societal and
technological developments is to frame them as "inevitable", they most
certainly are not. These developments are and have been motivated by
profit[^4], and thus only relate to a specific slice in history,
localized in a world with very specific ideologies. None of it is a
"natural conclusion" of the events that precede it, and nor will what
follows be a natural conclusion of the contemporary. These are
conscious choices and decisions, and thus _can be steered towards a
different vision of the present_ where the technologies we develop
exist to serve the people, the laborers and the communities that
surround them, and not the businesses that exist only to squeeze out
every last drop of humanity in us to have more to spend on frivolous
things.

[^4]: I'm in the process of reading _The Age of Surveillance
    Capitalism_ by Shoshana Zuboff, who does an amazing job at framing
    the problem at hand, and explaining the history of events
    surrounding Google's shift from gathering _behavioral surplus_ for
    the betterment of the service to instead collect data to fuel
    their revenue engine, which she claims more or less set the tone
    for a new mode of capitalism, concentrating on gathering
    behavioral surplus as much and as frequently as one can.

To reiterate, the correct technology for the job does not have to be
the most sophisticated, nor the one with the most moving parts. The
correct technology for the job _is the one that works_. It should be
as simple as it can be as long as it works. It can be a federated
collection of communication networks. It can be just a group of simple
blogs tacked together with a webring. It can be no digital
technologies at all. If it stirs up conversations in the physical
spaces where it's needed, then no technology is the correct amount of
technology. 

This is precisely the motto: <i class="fancy-italic">The tools serve
the purpose</i>.
