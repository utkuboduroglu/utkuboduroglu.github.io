title: The tools serve the purpose

I love the idea of *webrings*: they essentially organize people who
self-identify under some label, value or interest under a "collective
roof", so to speak.  For example, if you identify with the idea that
[you are opposed to AI](/about), then the ["no ai
webring"](https://baccyflap.com/noai/) is perfect for you!  You simply
apply to join the webring, and if you are accepted, you insert some
code in your personal webpage that links you to other people in the
webring in a way that, if you started to repeatedly visit the people
"to your right", you would eventually end up at your own blog; hence a
web<i>ring</i>. There's no need to go out and hope that an algorithm
connects you with other people who share the same interests as you,
and also hope that it doesn't harvest a bunch of behavioral data about
you and sell it to anyone who asks for it in the meantime. 

Webrings are a technology from a previous time, but by no means does
this mean that they're obsolete or primitive. As one of my favorite
lines from one of my favorite books goes:

I certainly believe that something as simple as the concept of a
webring is more in spirit of the "dream of the internet" as a system
that connects and enables people compared to the contemporary systems
of social media and data harvesting; I would even go so far as to say
that whatever current model of business these companies operate under
are _antithetical to serving people and our desires for a free
internet_. These systems may not have started out as structures
designed to exploit their users, but they certainly have devolved,
through the surrounding logic of surveillance capitalism, into
structures that exploit their users and customers for as much
behavioral data as possible, which acts as fuel for their
"revenue-producing machines".

Such a logic of exploitation and extraction, self-professed by the
"leaders of industry", cannot possibly serve the people and their
desires and demands for privacy, safety or the well-being of
themselves and their community. You absolutely can meet like-minded
people and form meaningful connections inside these structures, but
only because these connections are observable in a way that produces
revenue for the masters of said structures. You are only allowed to
hold these conversations because _you are given permission to do so_,
something that can be taken from you at any moment.

In a social structure where ideas like "exponential growth at all
costs" are central to the conduct of businesses, there is no way these
platforms will offer us a way out of their exploitative practices if
we _just ask nicely_; we need to talk about the conditions we're
subjugated to, and we need to act on our needs and desires. None of
that will be possible by conducting these conversations on the terms
laid out by those who profit from suppressing these conversations, and
thus the tools we need to facilitate such dialogue and action needs to
be built together and without conceding the necessary freedoms to
those who benefit from preventing us those freedoms.

This is why we need to gravitate towards technologies where we're
allowed to form communities and communicate, but also are given the
option to remake the rules of the communities together, and
conveniently migrate to ones that _do let us participate in such a
way_ if the current one is suddenly bought out for 44 billion $ by
some insecure manchild who wants an army of yes men and shills around
him. 

And this absolutely is possible! We already have federated
platforms[^1] such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) that rely
on a communication protocol called
[ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) that makes interacting with
others hassle-free. We have ideas from history, such as webrings, that
let you include yourself in communities you identify with, and
simultaneously express yourself without having to sell every single
detail about your digital and physical presence to companies to gain
passage into spaces you call your own, which already should be yours
without others' permission.

    _the fediverse_ [here](https://fediverse.party/)!

I also feel the need to stress a point here. A lot of the discussions
surrounding ideas like webrings or hosting your own personal blog
paints a picture that since these things are from a "yesteryear" of
the internet, they must be primitive or inferior to whatever we have
now. It is true that a personal webpage almost always has less bells
and whistles compared to a service like Instagram that is the product
of the thousands of people employed there, using their years worth of
expertise in roles that are specialized on doing very specific
things. But this does not mean that it's an archaic form of
interacting with each other. Suggesting that the spaces you carve out
for yourself are inherently less worthy because it looks worse than
something a couple thousand engineers produced with a total of a
hundred years' worth of labor, is just another way of framing digital
spaces exclusively as commodities, and that the only way you can keep
in touch with your communities or learn things or do business is by
_buying permission to do so_ from the people in charge, whether with
actual money or by consenting to be exploited and spied on.

You can reject this. The praxis that follows the rejection, and the
conversations necessary to carry out that praxis is not written down
in rules anywhere. There is no easy, prescribed way to carry out
change for better conditions for all, but it's possible by trying. So,
in this spirit, I want to use the remainder of this post to highlight
that certain practices, such as the use and development of free and
open source software, as well as investing time in forming communities
that follow different "logics" than that of contemporary platforms is
certainly a step in the right direction. But it is critical for you to
keep in mind that [these are just the tools and not the solution to
the
problem](https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/31/unsatisfying-answers/){:class="fancy-italic"}.

## Why FOSS matters
Let me preface this section by emphasising that although free[^2] and
open-source software _is not sufficient_ for obtaining these spaces
that offer us our freedoms, it certainly is necessary. [The reasons
for this are manifold](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/), however it
boils down to the following: you cannot form spaces that offer you the
freedom to privacy, security and agency _if the tools you use do not
allow you to freely modify or distribute them_. You cannot build a
foundation over systems where someone else can come along and rob you
of the functionality you rely on. This is already how it is; you have
no control over the recommendation algorithms for the apps you use. On
top of this, you cannot just probe into the program and take out all
the parts that do not interest you or harm you. It's precisely because
you are discouraged by [the obfuscation that comes with reading
assembly](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) or
the IP law [that heavily penalizes you if you modify these
programs](https://pluralistic.net/2025/02/22/ink-spattered-pitchforks/),
and such discouragement is intentional on the part of policymakers and
those who make these platforms. As such, it's all the more important
that [the tools we use serve the purpose at
hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does).

[^2]: <i class="fancy-italic">"Free not as in beer, but as in
    freedom"</i> is the commonly repeated phrase; it captures the
    idea that you have certain freedoms that come with software. You
    can read more about exactly what those are in this page detailing
    [What is Free
    Software?](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
