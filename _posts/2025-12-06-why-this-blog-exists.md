title: Why this blog exists
author: utku

Hey there, thanks for checking out my blog! I've been wanting to
re-open this blog for the purpose of sharing my thoughts and the sorts
of "experiments" I make throughout my daily life, but have constantly
found myself struggling. It more and more seems like my life has
started revolving around social networks or content platforms, where I
assume the role of a "passive observer", rather than someone who
actively engages with what I'm watching and reading. I couldn't shake
this feeling that the media we rely on _have stopped
mediating_. Instead, it felt like I fell into a sort of a sinkhole
that I desperately tried to climb out of but couldn't.

I constantly find myself wanting to share whatever cool things occupy
my mind at that particular moment, but also feel a necessity to
"censor" myself, so that the message I want to deliver can survive the
medium I want to relay it through. Most of these feelings were unnamed
for a long time, but I have recently come to identify more and more
[of the
elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) for
what it is—whether through reading texts on digital rights, social
construction etc.—and it's safe to say the _genesis_ of this blog can
be explained as such.

The main reason is that it has become impossible to inhabit a space on
the internet without being subjected to some form of _surveillance
capitalism_, where the platforms we rely on to keep in touch with our
loved ones or our coworkers or peers are under the control of a select
few who do everything in their power to turn these platforms against
us, exploiting our desire for community. As a result, these platforms
become increasingly predatory in their approach to mine more and more
of our personal information. Don't get me wrong, I do not think [any
form of individual change will solve
this](https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/31/unsatisfying-answers/); the
problems we're facing are societal and have everything to do with how
we've structured our social systems (or rather, how we've had our
_consent manufactured_ to let our systems be structured this way). It
therefore falls upon us to push back, because no one else will do it
for us.

Even though the problem is societal and not technological, and even
though I believe any form of individual action will not solve
this—trying to solve a problem geared towards consumption and labor
with a different form of consumption is akin to _rubbing ointment on a
stab wound_—there are steps one can take towards one's and their
community's emancipation: notably, platforming oneself to engage in
dialogue regarding the fundamental issues harming one's community. I
find it helps tremendously to write about what's happening and my
feelings surrounding it. I accept that I may be hastily reaching for
conclusions, but I do feel that it can't be a coincidence that
everyone I've talked to describes feelings of alienation and numbing
surrounding their lives. These feelings are intimately related to our
digital lives, but it's misleading to delineate the digital and the
"real": these systems permeate every aspect of our real lives. It's
impossible to live without interacting with these systems, and I'd
rather be very annoying about it and nag people if it helps spark
dialogue.

Apart from social issues surrounding digital spaces and the rights of
the people inhabiting them, whether voluntarily or not, I'm also
interested in various other subjects, ranging from pure mathematics
and computer science to science communication, to focusing on and
stressing the role of social construction in engaging with and
utilizing mathematics. I believe that a science such as mathematics
can only benefit from such a framing, and I wish to show this through
entries to this blog talking about anything and everything related to
these subjects. There's immense potential in terms of utilizing
everything we've managed to create with computers so far, and focus
them to the task of science exposition without pretending it exists in
a vacuum.

<small>These pages will still be changing rapidly for the first couple of
months this entry has been live, because I've found that waiting for
the blog to _resemble a final product before deploying it and before
writing entries for it_ makes the process effectively impossible. As a
result, the entirety of this blog is a **work in progress**.</small>
