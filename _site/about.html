<p>Hey there! I’m Utku, a Master’s student in the <a href="https://tum.de" target="_blank">Technical University
of Munich</a>, working on Higher Category Theory.  I’m specifically
interested in the intersection of category theory with programming,
though this is not what my thesis is about.</p>

<p>You can visit my <a href="https://github.com/utkuboduroglu" target="_blank">Github page</a> here, and you can contact me at</p>

<h1 id="about-this-blog">About this blog</h1>
<p>I’ve felt the need to open a blog, not just so I could have a place to
put my half-baked ideas, but also to share thoughts about things I do
in my life. You can read more about it here:</p>

<h2 id="on-the-use-of-javascript">On the use of JavaScript</h2>
<p>This page <em>currently contains JavaScript</em> for the purposes of
rendering TikZ diagrams and including KaTeX fonts, though both of
these things are subject to change. In any case, most of the page is
designed to not require JavaScript to view the contents. I do plan on
creating some interactive pages that will have to use JS in the
future, though this isn’t case as of yet.</p>
